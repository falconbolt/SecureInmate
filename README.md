## Inmate Database Management System (IDMS) project

# Welcome to the README for the Inmate Database Management System!

This system is designed to help manage data on inmates within a correctional facility. It allows for the storage and manipulation of inmate information, including personal details, sentence information, and disciplinary records

## Overview

The Inmate Database Management System (IDMS) is a software application designed to manage and organize information related to inmates within a correctional facility. It provides a centralized platform for storing and retrieving inmate data, facilitating efficient record-keeping, and streamlining administrative tasks for correctional staff.

## Features

1.	Inmate Profile Management: IDMS allows users to create and maintain comprehensive profiles for each inmate. This includes personal information, physical descriptions, medical history, sentencing details, and any relevant legal documents.   
2.	Booking and Release: The system supports the recording of inmate bookings, including capturing fingerprints, photographs, and storing information about arrest warrants, court orders, and release dates.   
3.	Inmate Tracking: IDMS enables real-time tracking of inmates within the facility. It includes features such as housing assignments, movement logs, and check-in/check-out functionalities.   
4.	Visitor Management: The system facilitates visitor registration, approval, and scheduling. It allows staff to generate visitor passes and record visitation details, ensuring controlled and secure access to inmates.  
5.	Incident Reporting: IDMS includes incident reporting functionality, enabling staff to document and track incidents involving inmates, such as fights, medical emergencies, or disciplinary actions. 
6.	Sentence Management: The system assists in managing inmate sentences, tracking time served, calculating release dates, and managing parole or probation details.    
7.	Communication Logs: IDMS maintains logs of inmate communications, including phone calls, mail, and email correspondence. It allows for monitoring and recording of conversations where necessary.   
8.	Reports and Analytics: The system provides comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities, enabling administrators to generate statistical reports, track trends, and gain insights into the inmate population. 
9.	Integration with External Systems: IDMS supports integration with external systems, such as law enforcement databases, court systems, or electronic monitoring systems, to exchange relevant inmate data seamlessly.    
10.	Security and Access Control: The system enforces robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of inmate data. It includes role-based access control to restrict system access based on user roles and permissions.   

## Technologies Used

The Inmate Database Management System is built using modern software development technologies and frameworks, which may include:

•	Programming Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express.js vs. Django (Python)    
•	Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): MongoDB  
•	Web Development: React.js, Express.js   
•	Server-side Framework: Node.js  
•	Security: secure protocols (HTTPS) and authentication mechanism (OAuth)     
•	Data Storage: Cloud storage services (Heroku)   
•	Version Control: Git    
•	Collaboration Platform: GitHub  
•	Integration: APIs and/or web services   
The specific technologies used may vary depending on the implementation requirements and the preferences of the development team.   

## Deployment

IDMS can be deployed in various ways, including:

1.	Local Deployment: The system is hosted on local servers within the correctional facility's network infrastructure. It requires appropriate hardware, networking, and system administration support. 
2.	Cloud Deployment: IDMS is hosted on a cloud platform Heroku, and has a scalable option for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. This option offers scalability, high availability, and reduces the need for on-premises infrastructure.    
3.	Hybrid Deployment: A combination of local and cloud deployment, where certain components or modules of the system are hosted locally, while others are hosted in the cloud. 
The deployment approach should consider factors such as security, performance, budget, and maintenance requirements.
